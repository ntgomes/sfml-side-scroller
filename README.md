# SFML Side Scroller

This project contains the code for a basic game engine that is extended to produce a simple side-scroller that has local server-client functionality for multiple players, made using SFML. This project was made as part of a university's game engine course, and was slightly modified for better file structure.

The side-scroller that this produces can be seen below:

## Locally Run
[WIP] Open this project in its root directory in Visual Studio and run Main.cpp.

## Design
See [the design documentation](https://github.com/ntgomes/sfml-side-scroller/blob/main/DESIGN.md) for the class diagram and explanation of the engine's game object model architecture.
